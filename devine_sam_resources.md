My favorite resources so far:

1. Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/
  - I used this site to explore basic Ruby concepts before getting started at Turing, but they have lots of great exercises for other languages as well, and it's free to use!

2. Learn Ruby the Hard Way: https://learncodethehardway.org/ruby/
  - This site has been popping up in Mod 1 prework and I really like the style of the exercises! It looks like there are other languages available as well, like Python, C, SQL, Javascript, and others.
